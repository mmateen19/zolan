## My Life is an Endless Cycle of Popping Pills. Lactase Pills, That is. 

I originally began this post to review plant-based milk. However, it's been over six months since I started this post. Since then, I have concluded that I hate all of them. I searched high and low, from almond to macadamia. In my opinion, nothing compares to normal, greenhouse gas-producing, climate change contributing cow milk. There is not much that can top the nostalgia that accompanies a tall glass of cold milk, or an iced coffee that doesn't cost $6+ because of my dietary requirements. I miss the days where I didn't have to doubt baristas and could eat cheese without wondering how quickly my stomach would digress. Or the days where a bottle of lactase pills wasn't my constant companion. This is supposed to be a milk review post, so I will give my two faithful readers what they did not request. Here is what I think about plant-based milk. 

## Plant-Based Milk and Why I Dislike Them All (in no particular order)

1. Almond Milk (aka the worst out of them all)
    - When almond milk is added to coffee, a chemical reaction occurs causing it to alter the flavor completely and curdle. One of the only ways to prevent this is to use a barista brand of almond milk, which I don't have the energy to find and purchase. 
2. Coconut Milk (I'm not fruity enough for this)
    - Okay, I don't like coconut flavors to begin with (unless it's in a pina colada) so it makes sense why I disliked this nut milk. I will say, however, it has the best texture out of them all. 
3. Cashew Milk (if I wanted water I would have drunk water) 
    - It's discolored water. 
4. Macadamia Milk (I don't like it. Don't ask me why.) 
    - It's just not good, okay? 
6. Hazelnut Milk (I know it's nut-milk, but it's too nutty) 
    - Like seriously?? Why ruin a perfectly good cup of coffee with this milk? 
8. Oat Milk
    This is by far my favorite out of all the milk substitutes. Some brands do an awful job with their oat milk (brand name rhymes with ...Janet boat??), but others like Califia Farms and Oatly do a wonderful job. 


I hope you enjoyed my rant. Don't hate, if you like any of these milks, you're luckier than me. Thank you for reading.
