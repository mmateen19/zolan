Hey! I'm glad you're reading this! This is a personal website I'm creating to learn more about what interests me. If you're here, that means you're at least a little curious to know what that is too. I'm proud to say that since I started this website in 2019, I've gained a lot of experience. Through wonderful professors, my excellent peers, and many many YouTube videos- I've been exposed to many wonderful facets of Computer Science! I'm excited to start my career after graduating and learn even more! 

This website was initially created to display my academic projects. However, I found more pleasure in talking about my interests that didn't relate to academia. I love cooking, baking, and writing sarcastic blog posts. Reading is a hobby I'm determined to invest more time in, and I really enjoy rock climbing as well. If you are interested in learning more about my achievements, feel free to check out my resume on LinkedIn or shoot me an email!
